How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations, and why is this beneficial?

Node.js is able to handle asynchronous operations through an event loop and it's non-blocking architecture.
When operations like reading a file or a network request is initiated, Node.js offloads that work to the 
system so it doesn't impede on the main execution code. Then it uses callbacks to get that information 
whenever the main thread is available.

This is beneficial because it has better performance since asynchronous operations can be run without 
blocking the main thread and it improves scalability allowing Node.js to handle simultaneous connections 
which is ideal for use cases with APIs and real-time applications.
