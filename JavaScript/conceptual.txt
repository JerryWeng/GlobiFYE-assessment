What are the differences between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?

`==` is the equality operator and `===` is the strict equality operator.
The main difference between these two comparison operators is how they compare values.
`==` compares two values after doing a type conversion.
`===` compares two values without doing a type conversion

For example:
let num = 10;
let str = '10';

console.log(num == str); This would output true because the values are the same after type conversion
console.log(num === str); This would output false because the values are two different types
