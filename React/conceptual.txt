What is the purpose of React's `useEffect` hook? Provide an example use case.

The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in your components. Some examples include data fetching, DOM manipulation, subscribing to events, etc

One example use case is on our counter code, we can use useEffect to console.log the count number.
A "side effect" of incrementing or decrementing our counter.

useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("the count number: ", count)
}, [count])
